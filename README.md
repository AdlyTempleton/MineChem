Minechem III
=========

Minechem III is a mod about science. Originally maintained by ljdp, Minechem III is maintained by Rushmead and open source contributors, and is based off the work of the previous iteration Minechem II. Split apart materials into their most basic components, then mesh them all together into something new. The possibilities are endless!
